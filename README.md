# Alergi
Making eating out safer and accessible for people with food allergies.

Alergi is an easy to use web application that allows users to input their restrictions in any language along with an image of a menu in order to receive a list of items from that menu which fit their dietary needs. Additionally, our ML model will measure the semantic similarity between words to suggest other items which may also be unsafe to consume. Just from their phones, users will be equipped with the confidence to go out and eat without worrying about their restrictions getting in the way.
